Hacking and Contributing
------------------------

The JavaScript code is now generated from TypeScript, so make sure you modify the
TypeScript and compile it, rather than modifying the JavaScript directly. To start
auto-compiling the TypeScript code, you may use:

```
/home/ethers> npm run auto-build
```

A very important part of ethers is its exhaustive test cases, so before making any
bug fix, please add a test case that fails prior to the fix, and succeeds after the
fix. All regression tests must pass.

Pull requests are always welcome, but please keep a few points in mind:

- Compatibility-breaking changes will not be accepted; they may be considered for the next major version
- Security is important; adding dependencies require fairly convincing arguments
- The library aims to be lean, so keep an eye on the `dist/ethers.min.js` file size before and after your changes
- Add test cases for both expected and unexpected input
- Any new features need to be supported by us (issues, documentation, testing), so anything that is overly complicated or specific may not be accepted

In general, **please start an issue before beginning a pull request**, so we can have a public discussion. :)

Ancillary Packages
------------------

These are a number of packages not included in the umbrella `ethers` npm package, and
additional packages are always being added. Often these packages are for specific
use-cases, so rather than adding them to the umbrella package, they are added as
ancillary packages, which can be included by those who need them, while not bloating
everyone else with packages they do not need.

We will keep a list of useful packages here.

- `@ethersproject/experimental` ([documentation](https://docs.ethers.io))
- `@ethersproject/cli` ([documentation](https://docs.ethers.io))
- `@ethersproject/hardware-wallets` ([documentation](https://docs.ethers.io))
